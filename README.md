# Predictive Modeling of Customer Churn for ADFC Bank Using Machine Learning.
---
## üéØOverview:
Customer churn is one of the most critical challenges facing ADFC Bank, directly impacting revenue, profitability, and long-term growth. This project aims to analyze historical banking data to predict customer attrition before it happens by leveraging machine learning. This project seeks to imply data-driven strategy by moving beyond intuition to AI-powered insights on why customers leave‚Äîwhether due to dissatisfaction, competitive offers, or life-stage changes by identifying at-risk customers early so that ADFC Bank can deploy targeted interventions (e.g., personalized offers, service recovery) to improve loyalty.

Extrcated customer attrition insights dataset from ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marusagar/bank-customer-attrition-insights) using Kaggle API:

- __Bank-Customer-Attrition-Insights-Data__


In this project, we have utilized the above mentioned dataset, which contains contains **10,000 records** of ADFC Bank customers with 18 attributes. Key features include:
